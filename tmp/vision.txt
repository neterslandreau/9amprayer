I had a vision of the cloud of witnesses looking down on the earth
seeing the prayers of mankind rising to our Creator, and the thought 
occured to me, how marvelous it would appear to these witnesses to
see bursts of prayers along an entire longitude of the earth going
up to our God simultaneously! What a glorious opportunity to give
glory to our Redeemer!

That is why I started this movement to encourage people everywhere,
or every nationality and every society, to stop at 9am local time
and recite the prayer our Lord taught His disciples when they asked
Him how they should pray.

That is why I am asking everyone, everywhere to stop at 9am and glorify
the One who saved us by taking less than 1/2 of a minutes and 
remembering the prayer He taught us.
